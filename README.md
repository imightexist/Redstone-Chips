# Redstone-Chips
A Minecraft 1.16.5 mod where you make mini machines. The project will most likely be worked on after EggCraft.

# very long way to explain it
To get to the portal, you need to craft a Redstone Chip Portal Frame. The dimension will be limited on how high the portal is, the length and width will be as big as how long the portal is. To activate the portal, you need to craft a Redstone Chip and one of the portal frames must be nearby it. After getting activated you can jump in the portal and get into an empty bedrock box with the same area as the portal. You can craft a Redstone Chip End that is the source of the redstone signal and (might be added) the output redstone signal. Placing the Redstone Chip End in any other dimension will make it explode after 5 seconds. Sounds from note blocks will be in the output of the "chip", and you could bring entities in. There will be an activated portal to get out of the chip dimension with the wall behind it being bedrock to prevent getting out. After getting out, the Redstone chip you placed earlier will have the block data in it, and now you have a redstone component. To get the item, break it with any pickaxe and the portal will be deactivated. Reactivating it will have the same dimension if you use the same Redstone Chip.
